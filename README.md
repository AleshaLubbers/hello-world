# hello-world
First GitHub project

Well, I suppose a "Hello, World!" is in order. 
Just testing this "GitHub" thing really works, but damn, I wish I had used this in university (even if my team mates were mostly non-existent so that this wouldn't have made a difference either way)... 
In any case, for now, Alesha out!
